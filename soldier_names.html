      <h3>Meaningful Soldier Names in 17th century Sweden</h3>
    <div class="flex-container-row">
		<section>
			When looking for research and publications on the topic of <em>meaningful names</em>, I stumbled upon the  
<a href="https://www.hhogman.se/naming-practice-sweden.htm#Soldier-Names">wonderfully well researched website made by Hans Högman.</a> This
specific type of name is present in large numbers in MBotF, and as Högman explains:
<blockquote>At the end of the 17th century the Army and later the Navy started to give the
soldiers special surnames. When a soldier was enrolled the Captain of the
Company gave him a special 'soldier name'. In each Company the soldiers had
to have a unique last name. When an order was given to a certain soldier only one
soldier was to react. These soldier names were of special character, many of the
names had a military touch. Normally the names consisted of only one word.</blockquote>
