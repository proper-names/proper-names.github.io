      <h3>Meaningful or Intentional Names</h3>

      <div class="flex-container-row">
        <section>
          <blockquote>The main idea of an intentional name is
            deceptively straightforward: they 'direct the reader towards certain scenes, scripts and
            schemata', for example by having a 'special cultural significance due to its historical or
            literary associations', or provide 'additional characteristics of the heroes' (Hejwowski 154-155). Thus described, intentional proper names seem to add value to the story
            (and its ontology) that cannot easily be achieved without them.</blockquote>

      <h3>Meaningful Soldier Names in 17th century Sweden</h3>
      <div class="flex-container-row">
        <section>
          When looking for research and publications on the topic of <em>meaningful names</em>, I stumbled upon the
          <a href="https://www.hhogman.se/naming-practice-sweden.htm#Soldier-Names">wonderfully well researched website made by Hans Högman.</a> This
          specific type of name is present in large numbers in MBotF, and as Högman explains:
          <blockquote>At the end of the 17th century the Army and later the Navy started to give the
            soldiers special surnames. When a soldier was enrolled the Captain of the
            Company gave him a special 'soldier name'. In each Company the soldiers had
            to have a unique last name. When an order was given to a certain soldier only one
            soldier was to react. These soldier names were of special character, many of the
            names had a military touch. Normally the names consisted of only one word.</blockquote>

      <h3>Meaningful Names in <cite>The Malazan Book of the Fallen</cite></h3>
      <div class="flex-container-row">
        <section> Out of the more than 600 names present in the main series alone, at least one third of the names could be categorised as intentional or meaningful. The bearers of these names vary wildly in profession, temperament and connection to the military, Malazan or otherwise. That being said, the soldier names in the Malazan military were usually given by the infamous Master Sergeant Braven Tooth (Erikson, 251-252), whose name is also a perfect example of the trend.</section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>Braven Tooth — his tooth got chipped in a tavern fight</li>
            <li>Twilight, Rise, Watch, Awakening Dawn — titles with their equivalents in the (not extensively mentioned) conlang of the Shake race; however both their English and Polish realisations give the perfect image of a culture focused around the sun cycles;</li>
            <li>Tarr - Tarcz, Scant — Nikły, Blend - Niewidka; three Malazan soldier names pertaining to the physical abilities;</li>
            <li>Faint — Blada, Picker — Wykałaczka, Ruffle — Kryza; three referring to their physical qualities;</li>
            <li>Smiles — Śmieszka, Kisswhere — Całuśnica, Kindly — Milutek; three referring to their character, the way they act.</li>
