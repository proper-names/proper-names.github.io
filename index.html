        Names are everywhere. At work, at home, in movies and books. They make people go 'huh?', vulgar names can be used in anger or in ridicule. I try to examine names, in every context and of every category. This page is a preview of what it truly means to research names.

      <h3>Reddit as a source of data</h3>
      <section>
        Whether for the purpose of gathering a consensus,
        or examining others’ opinions, Reddit proves an excellent source of information.
        Examples of users expressing their approval of the choice of names in the series include:
        'My favorites are Envy, Malice, and Spite. Draconus knew what his daughter’s [sic] were
        going to be and named them accordingly. Imagine if we did this in real life?' To which
        someone answered: 'On that note I love Hood. I never thought about it before reading the
        series but it’s the perfect name for a god of death.' In another comment a mention of humour: 'Apt, Sorry, Sunrise. Any name that is unto itself a joke […]'. The results of such a simple query underline the fact that
        catchy names belonging to engaging characters are especially popular with the readers.
        This type of approach allows for the people who are not involved in academic discourse
        to introduce their point to the academics in any field.
